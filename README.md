# Hostel-Management
This is a hostel management software that I made when I was 12 years old. The software uses Java for the front-end and a mySQL local database to securely save all the data.
The GUI is made with help of the swing package available for Java. The software, however, is not completely versatile for all hostels. As each hostels have a different amount of 
capacities and requirements, slight tweaks were necessary for every hostel that I made this software for. All in all, I sold my software to 6 hostels in my city and nearby places.

Anyone who wants to review this project has my permission to do so. However, as the SQL database was saved to each device individually. A user will have to set up their own SQL database
and link it with this software. I believe anyone with sufficient knowledge in the field can do so :)

How To Run :-

1. Download and save the repository in a folder.
2. Open the Hostel folder, and then open the dist folder.
3. In the dist folder, there is an executable Jar File called Hostel, which will run the software.
4. Additionally, to tweak the code, anyone can open up this project via Netbeans(what I used), or Eclipse IDE.
